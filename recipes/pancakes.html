        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Fluffy Pancakes – soft, light and fluffy pancakes made from scratch with a beautiful golden brown color and taller rise. A melt-in-your-mouth breakfast experience.This homemade pancake mix has baking powder which is a leavening agent responsible for forming those pockets of bubbles when cooking pancake. Combined with baking soda, this immediately begins to produce gas as soon as you mix the batter. That’s why it’s a rule of thumb to cook it right away to achieve a tall and fluffy pancake.  </p>
        <p>The second secret of this recipe is the presence of whipped egg whites. Yep, just like sponge cake cakes. The protein in those egg whites forms into a few bubbles as soon as you beat them. When you fold it into the batter, it adds the extra air and as it expands during cooking, it makes the pancakes lighter.</p>
        <p>And lastly, the buttermilk. It’s a no brainer how buttermilk makes any cakes moist. So instead of the regular milk, I’m adding instead a 1 and 3/4 cup of buttermilk for that bit of tang flavor, rich and moist interior. This ensures that the pancake is tender while the egg yolk helps set the pancakes as they cook.</p>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a Large bowl combine flour, salt, sugar, baking soda and nutmeg (if using any), whisk to fully combine.</li>
            <li>In another medium bowl combine egg yolks, milk, melted butter and vanilla. Thoroughly mix.</li>
            <li>Whisk egg whites until fluffy about 3-5 minutes. Then  add to pancake, mix as little as possible until fully combine. You will have a thick batter. Do not over mix.</li>
            <li>Heat a lightly oiled cast iron or frying pan over medium high heat.  Scoop about ¼ cup each of the batter onto the cast. You will probably need to help spread the batter.</li>
            <li>Gently flatten with a back of a spatula or back of a spoon to even out the batter. Fry until bubbles start to appear on surface and edges of pancake starts to brown about 2-3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Flip and cook the other side for another minute or two until golden brown. Repeat until pancake mixture is finished.</li>
            <li>Remove and serve immediately with syrup and/or butter.</li>
        </ol>
