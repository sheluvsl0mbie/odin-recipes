        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <h3>Pastry Crust</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Butter or spray a 9-inch pie pan with a removable bottom – making sure it is has been adequately sprayed. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Place flour, salt and sugar in a food processor pulse for a couple of times to mix ingredients.</li>
            <li>Throw in butter and pulse until rough dough forms.</li>
            <li>Then add egg yolk - pulse until the dough barely comes.</li>
            <li>Remove dough place on a work surface - knead just enough to incorporate all the dough. Working the dough as little as possible.</li>
            <li>Do not overwork the dough; otherwise it’ll be too tough. When it’s ready, the dough will be barely moistened and come together into a ball.</li>
            <li>Lightly press the dough on the prepare pie pan – working from the center up until the bottom and sides are fully covered with pastry – again be very gentle when pressing the dough onto the pie pan.</li>
            <li>Place pie pan in the freezer and freeze for at least 30 minutes or more this helps prevent the dough from rising- if you are in a rush brick, then bake with beans to prevent rising.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C) and place rack in center of oven.</li>
            <li>Bake crust for about 20 to 25 minutes or until the crust is dry and golden browned. Set aside.</li>
        </ol>

            <li>Place saucepan over medium heat, add butter, nutmeg and milk -bring to a boil and remove from the heat.</li>
            <li>In another bowl, mix together flour, cornstarch, sugar, vanilla and almond extract- whisk in eggs until smooth. Gently whisk into the saucepan making sure there are no lumps</li>
            <li>Now return the pan back on the stove – keep stirring constantly until in starts to bubble.</li>
